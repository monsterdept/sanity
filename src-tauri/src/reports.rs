//! The project list, and the sizes behind the delete button.
//!
//! **No readings.** They live in `.sanity/` in the repo (`assessment.rs`) and nowhere
//! else. This file used to hold a per-project store keyed by the repo's absolute path,
//! and the code for it is gone rather than disabled: a second home for readings meant
//! deleting the visible copy silently restored an older invisible one, and no amount of
//! care at the call site fixes a design where the user cannot tell which copy they are
//! looking at. Leaving the functions here for "just in case" is how that comes back.
//!
//! What remains is the project list, and nothing else. There was briefly a panel that
//! itemised and deleted everything here — it existed because readings were invisible and
//! unreachable, and once they moved into the repo `rm -rf .sanity` (or `git checkout`)
//! does the same job with a diff you can read first.
